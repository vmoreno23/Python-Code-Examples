# Python-Code-Examples
  Hello my name is Victor, I maintain and contribute to these programs.
There are seven Python code programs within this repository. Each example is simple and has an objective. To use each of the programs paste the program's code into a text editor with Python support, run the program, and follow any on screen instructions and the results will be provided.<br> 

  The purpose of the first program is to display "hello world". A basic code to display text in Python.<br>
  
  The purpose of the second program is to greet the user using their name that they entered. This demonstrates recieving input from the user and displaying their input.<br>
  
  The purpose of the third program is to build off displaying a user's input name by limiting which names can be used. This demonstrates the ability to change a program's output based on user input and "if" statements.<br> 

  The purpose of the fourth program is to compute the area of a circle by recieving a circle's radius through user input. This demonstrates the use of operators in a program to solve mathematical problems. This is an example of reassigning variables and transforming string values to float values.<br>

  The purpose of the fifth program is to compute miles per gallon (MPG) for a vehicle. This also demonstrates the ability to solve mathematical problems in the program, tranform string values to float values, and reassign variables.<br>

  The purpose for the sixth program is to convert temperature in degree fahrenheit recieved from user input to temperature in degrees celsius. The program demonstrates solving mathematical problems, tranforming string values to float values, and reassigning variables as well.<br>

  The purpose of the seventh program is to determine which day of the week a person will return from a vacation. This would depend on which day of the week they left initially. The program recieves starting day of the vaction and how long (in days) the vacation was from user input. This demonstrates the use of an "if" statement to help solve a logical problem.<br>
